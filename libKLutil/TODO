- Gzip gets completely messed up on 'sole'.  It does the
  job but complains about it.  (Sounds like people I know...)
  When I specifically write 'gzip -S .gz lib....' it works
  fine, but I use a variable, GZIP = -S .gz, $(GZIP) lib...
  it goes bezerk.  It works fine on Rainette.  Go figure!

- Write documentation.
- Use UNAME to set OS.
- Write a configure script.

- test ynquestion

- Write a test suite!

- What the heck?!  lvector is *unsigned* long.  there are no
	signed long vector. yet there is a long matrix, and an
	unsigned long matrix, although that last one is only calloc.
	What a freaking mess!  What was I thinking.  That needs to
	be fixed and all the code using those need to be cleaned up.

- add a verbose flag to findindex to turn off the error messaging.
	Also, I'm not sure not finding the value in the vector should
	be considered an 'internal error'; it's just not in there.

- month.c shouldn't exit if the month index is beyond range.
	It should throw an exception or something.

- utc2local is clunky.  Also, it would be nice to have more time
	manipulation functions.

- Need to add tests for myutil.c/myutil.h and mystruct.c/mystruct.h
