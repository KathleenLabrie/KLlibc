V1.0.0
18 January 2001: Ported to Linux RedHat.

V1.0.1
3 April 2001:  In 'read_image'.
	Commented out 'free(fptr);'  I don't know where I originaly
	got the idea to write that line.  I have discovered that it causes
	some serious memory allocation problems.  I guess 'fits_close_file'
	takes care of 'fptr' just like 'fits_open_file' takes care of 
	creating it.  I suspect that the old version of CFITSIO didn't
	free the pointer and that the new version does.  The sample programs
	that came with CFITSIO, and on which read_image is based on, do not
	have the 'free(fptr)' line.

10 April 2001:  [v1.1.0]
	'edit_image': Removed #define's related to time, and include
		mytime.h instead. Removed prototypes for utc2local and
		cnvtimefmt: they're in mytime.h.  Also removed prototype for
		printerror and included "./KLcfitsio.h" instead. [v1.2.0]

	'read_image': Removed prototype for printerror, included 
		"./KLcfitsio.h" [v1.0.2]

	'read_key': Removed prototypes for printerror and get_type, included
		"./KLcfitsio.h" [v1.0.1]

	'write_key': Removed prototypes for printerror and get_type, included
		"./KLcfitsio.h" [v1.0.1]

	'write_numbered_key': Removed prototypes for printerror and write_key,
		included "./KLcfitsio.h" [v1.0.1]
