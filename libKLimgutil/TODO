- Gzip gets completely messed up on 'sole'.  It does the
  job but complains about it.  (Sounds like people I know...)
  When I specifically write 'gzip -S .gz lib....' it works
  fine, but I use a variable, GZIP = -S .gz, $(GZIP) lib...
  it goes bezerk.  It works fine on Rainette.  Go figure!

- Write documentation.
- shared libraries?
